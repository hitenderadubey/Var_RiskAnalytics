This Python project calculates Value at Risk (VaR) for a financial portfolio using three key methods:

Historical VaR: Estimates risk based on past price movements.

Monte Carlo Simulation: Models future risk using statistical methods.

Stress Testing: Evaluates portfolio performance under extreme scenarios (e.g., market crashes).
